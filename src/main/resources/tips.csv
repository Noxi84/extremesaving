Having no fridge makes you really conscious of what you need & what you really don’t ... & what a great way to live I say.
If you live in a city- you do not need a refrigerator. AT ALL.
Ditch the fridge. Is the convenience REAL, or just habitual? Remember that this was one of the selling points drummed into us to get us to buy fridges. Keep in mind that lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, and herbs (basically anything with a stem) will store incredibly well if the end of the stem is placed in water (just the tip of the stem should be submerged). You can also create a cool space in the basement to store your food.
Learn to patch clothes.
Ditch the TV.
Don't use batteries at all. Use the controls on the device directly. This will also make you just a little bit more active.
Don't buy new, buy second hand.
Lose the bad habits: You smoke? Drink? Gamble? Eat a chocolate bar and pop every day? You know you’re just tossing away money by the handful, right? Besides, none of that is anything close to healthy.
Cook at home and cook from scratch.
It’s fun – make it a game: For some people the extreme saving can become almost a game – where they find ways to save more and spend less – and win the game by reaching their goals.
You get to be more creative!: When you have set limits on how much you can spend you’ll be more creative about how you go out and have fun.  Instead of an expensive dinner and movie out, why not a bike ride and a picnic at the park!
Simplified life with less stuff:  When you’re buying less stuff, you’ll have less stuff to worry about, and a much more simplified life!
Sense of freedom: When you no longer work, or at least when you find yourself in a place where you’re able to work less  if you want to, it will give you a big sense of freedom – of being able to do the things you want.
You can retire much sooner: If you go extreme with your savings, you’ll be able to retire much sooner than the average person. Go very extreme by saving 70-80% of your income, you might be able to retire in 7-10 years!
While most people immediately think of all the perceived downsides to being an extreme saver – like not being able to have any fun – they often don’t think of the benefits.
Peace of mind: When you’re saving so much of your income you’ll see your cash reserves and retirement accounts growing so much faster – which will give ou a whole lot more peace of mind.
Extreme couponing: Some people will take couponing to a whole other level, finding ways to double up coupons, take advantage of sales, and only buy items when they’re on sale.  In some cases they use multiple coupons to get items for free!  The downside is that often this can be almost a full time job. The good news is that even a lazy couponer can still save a good amount of money.
Extreme frugality: Do things other people aren’t willing to do – things like not using toilet paper, not flushing, showering and doing laundry at the same time, dumpster diving.  Here’s a look at some folks who do that sort of thing. I tend to avoid most of these things.
Cancel all services except ones necessary to live:  Some people won’t pay for anything except for the services they need to live – like heat, water, electricity. Even those they will do their best to skimp on.
Cut out the vices:  If you’re a smoker, drinker or if you gamble on a regular basis, cutting out these vices can save you hundreds of dollars a year.
Live without AC or with minimal heating:  I was reading on one site how one extreme saver would allow his home to get extremely warm in hot weather without using the AC, and allow the house to get down to as low as 65 in the winter. He said he adapted quickly to the new temps.
Downgrade to a tiny house or rent:  Downgrade your living situation on one of your biggest expenses, and save big money.
Downgrade your car, or go without one: Some folks will go completely without a car, riding only on mass transit or biking to work.  Others will downgrade from a nicer car to an older and cheaper model that gets decent mileage.
Buy everything used or freecycling: There are so many things that you can just buy used and save a ton of money.  For example, we recently bought my son a new bike. Instead of spending €100-150 buying it new, we found a nice used one for only €40 at a local store.  You can often find things free through your local freecycle site or facebook groups.
Never eat out:  If you trying to be extreme in your saving, you may need to cut the eating out, and eat mainly at home.  Not as extreme? Cut back on the number of times you eat out and you can still save a decent amount.
