Having no fridge makes you really conscious of what you need & what you really don’t ... & what a great way to live I say.
If you live in a city- you do not need a refrigerator. AT ALL.
Ditch the fridge. Is the convenience REAL, or just habitual? Remember that this was one of the selling points drummed into us to get us to buy fridges. Keep in mind that lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, and herbs (basically anything with a stem) will store incredibly well if the end of the stem is placed in water (just the tip of the stem should be submerged). You can also create a cool space in the basement to store your food.
Learn to patch clothes.
Ditch the TV.
Don't use batteries at all. Use the controls on the device directly. This will also make you just a little bit more active.
Don't buy new, buy second hand.
Lose the bad habits: You smoke? Drink? Gamble? Eat a chocolate bar and pop every day? You know you’re just tossing away money by the handful, right? Besides, none of that is anything close to healthy.
Cook at home and cook from scratch.
It’s fun – make it a game: For some people the extreme saving can become almost a game – where they find ways to save more and spend less – and win the game by reaching their goals.
You get to be more creative!: When you have set limits on how much you can spend you’ll be more creative about how you go out and have fun.  Instead of an expensive dinner and movie out, why not a bike ride and a picnic at the park!
Simplified life with less stuff:  When you’re buying less stuff, you’ll have less stuff to worry about, and a much more simplified life!
Sense of freedom: When you no longer work, or at least when you find yourself in a place where you’re able to work less  if you want to, it will give you a big sense of freedom – of being able to do the things you want.
You can retire much sooner: If you go extreme with your savings, you’ll be able to retire much sooner than the average person. Go very extreme by saving 70-80% of your income, you might be able to retire in 7-10 years!
While most people immediately think of all the perceived downsides to being an extreme saver – like not being able to have any fun – they often don’t think of the benefits.
Peace of mind: When you’re saving so much of your income you’ll see your cash reserves and retirement accounts growing so much faster – which will give you a whole lot more peace of mind.
Extreme couponing: Some people will take couponing to a whole other level, finding ways to double up coupons, take advantage of sales, and only buy items when they’re on sale.  In some cases they use multiple coupons to get items for free!  The downside is that often this can be almost a full time job. The good news is that even a lazy couponer can still save a good amount of money.
Extreme frugality: Do things other people aren’t willing to do – things like not using toilet paper, not flushing, showering and doing laundry at the same time, dumpster diving.  Here’s a look at some folks who do that sort of thing. I tend to avoid most of these things.
Cancel all services except ones necessary to live:  Some people won’t pay for anything except for the services they need to live – like heat, water, electricity. Even those they will do their best to skimp on.
Cut out the vices:  If you’re a smoker, drinker or if you gamble on a regular basis, cutting out these vices can save you hundreds of dollars a year.
Live without AC or with minimal heating:  I was reading on one site how one extreme saver would allow his home to get extremely warm in hot weather without using the AC, and allow the house to get down to as low as 65 in the winter. He said he adapted quickly to the new temps.
Downgrade to a tiny house or rent:  Downgrade your living situation on one of your biggest expenses, and save big money.
Downgrade your car, or go without one: Some folks will go completely without a car, riding only on mass transit or biking to work.  Others will downgrade from a nicer car to an older and cheaper model that gets decent mileage.
Buy everything used or freecycling: There are so many things that you can just buy used and save a ton of money.  For example, we recently bought my son a new bike. Instead of spending €100-150 buying it new, we found a nice used one for only €40 at a local store.  You can often find things free through your local freecycle site or facebook groups.
Never eat out:  If you trying to be extreme in your saving, you may need to cut the eating out, and eat mainly at home.  Not as extreme? Cut back on the number of times you eat out and you can still save a decent amount.
Cutting your hair at home is a great way to save money. In our household, men’s haircuts are $30/week. That’s a whopping $1,500+ per year. It can be even more expensive for women and beauty salon appointments that can rake up to $100 or more per visit!
Investing in some hair styling tools like clippers or hair cutting scissors is a good way to save money on your grooming expenses. Some have even gone so far as to shave their head, to keep maintenance and costs down. This includes men and women, by the way! Or, never cut it and just grow it out.
Lower of cost of living, literally. Here are some ideas to do this: Live in a small house. Get roommates. Don’t use A/C or heat. Cut the cable.
Rent out unused rooms in your place with rental arbitrage. You might wonder how some people can make such extreme changes but these changes won’t last forever. Some of these money savers can help reduce your expenses by thousands each year.
Move your Family in with Family: Living with family and moving back home is such a budget saver. You can potentially pay no rent or very little rent, while you or you and the family take up a spare room or the basement in your parent’s place.
You might have to really give this one some thought. When you go to the grocery store, buy whole foods and use every part, if you can.
No junk food including, chips, cookies, crackers, or ice cream. No tea bags or coffee pods. No frozen dinners. Nothing in a box or can
You will be preparing your meals and food at home. This will take more time and more work but your wallet will thank you.
You will be drinking filtered tap water. No more bottled water or water filters. You’ll enjoy good ol’ tap water. Invest in a reusable water bottle and fill it up when you’re on the go, at public water fountains or restrooms. This easy change will save you a ton of money!
Hand Wash Laundry: Save on laundry costs by hand washing and line drying your garments. It is more work but it reduces the wear on your clothes and saves you money.
Grow your Food: Growing your food is a cost effective way to lower your food budget. You can’t grow everything but there is a lot that you can grow, like expensive produce. Buying local from your farmer’s market is a good way to save money while supporting local farmers too.
Switch Banks: Switching banks comes with many perks including hundreds of dollars, free appliances and other freebies when you join a new bank. So, why not switch banks to take advantage?
Only shopping on sales means if it’s not on sale, you aren’t buying it.
Live in Your Car: A lot of people are starting to do this to save money. The cost of renting an apartment, up to $1,000+ is saved every month and can be applied to savings or your debts.
Regifting: Do you know those gifts you receive for yourself that you don’t like? Don’t throw them away, regift! This will save you a ton on gifts that you’ll be buying throughout the year for birthdays and other events.
Ask for Refunds: Have you ever paid a membership for the month and cancelled halfway through or before the month ended? Why not ask for a refund. Even a prorated refund is a win, getting money back for the portion of the month you didn’t use. A lot of people don’t even think to do this, but ask. You might be surprised how often you’ll get a refund back!
Live a Petless Life: Pets are expensive. They can bring joy and serenity to your life. They can truly feel like part of the family but the truth is, the upkeep for having a pet can be high.
One Meal a Day: Go even more extreme, eating just one meal a day. People who fast do this for the purposes of losing weight.  Can you imagine how much you’d save on your grocery bill if you shopped for one meal a day, instead of three meals plus snacks!
Don’t shower every day. Shower every two days to save money on water and soap usage.
Reduce shampooing. Many experts believe that shampooing more than two or three times a week is not good for your hair–plus it will really save you on shampoo.
No more toilet paper. Some frugal people stop spending money on toilet paper and use newspaper or cloth towels instead.
Take a navy shower. With a navy shower, you only turn on water to get your body wet and again to rinse the soap off. You’ll save a ton of money on both water and the energy spent heating that water.
Darn your socks. If you get a hole in your socks, don’t throw them away, darn them.
Cut your own hair. Especially if you are a guy and can get away with a simple buzz cut, cutting your own hair is an excellent way to save money.
Collect rainwater. Collecting rainwater to use for your yard, garden, and any other use around the house will reduce your water bill.
Sell luxury items. Some things are just a luxury to own and actually cost more money just by having them. A boat, two or more cars, jet skis, a motorcycle, and other luxury items cost gas, insurance, maintenance, and storage to own.
Water down your products. Shampoo, cleaning supplies, and more will last much longer if you water them down a bit.
Use selective flushing. Many people choose not to flush the toilet after each use, limiting flushes to every second or third pee and when solids are present.
Get rid of big stuff. Sell your unused furniture, appliances you don’t use, or any of the other big stuff around your house that is just taking up space.
Learn to live without heat or air conditioning. Less than 100 years ago people lived just fine without central heat or air conditioning–and many in countries around the world still do. Imagine how much you would save if you eliminated these two expenses.
Put high-energy electronics on a timer. Plug TVs, DVD players, and other high-energy usage appliances in to a timer so that they are not using energy at night and are available again during the day.
Live off the land. Grow your own vegetables and herbs and raise your own livestock for consumption to cut your grocery bill considerably.
Cook from scratch. Learning to cook your own food from scratch can save you a bundle.
Cut out alcohol. Alcohol costs plenty of money. Stop drinking to really save money.
Sell your car. This definitely feels extreme for some, but selling your car will save you a ton of money. With so many other forms of transportation available, why opt for the most expensive one?
Walk. Walk or ride your bike when your destination is only one or two miles away.
Public transportation. Take public transportation any time you can. A monthly pass for the bus or light rail is probably cheaper than gas, maintenance, and parking expenses.
Move to be closer to work or school. Make sure you live close enough to walk or bike to work or school so you don’t have to own a car.
Drive a scooter. Scooters are relatively inexpensive and get awesome gas mileage, often around 100 mpg.
Stop buying. It is extreme, but see if you can stop making purchases all together for 30 days. Not only will you save money, but you will also begin to see ways to do things without spending money for the long term.
Live like a farmer. Go to bed when the sun sets and rise when the sun rises so that you use less electricity.
You only need to drink water to survive. Cut out all coffee, soda and alcohol. Only drink water and sometimes tea.
