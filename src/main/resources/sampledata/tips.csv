Having no fridge makes you really conscious of what you need & what you really don’t ... & what a great way to live I say.
If you live in a city- you do not need a refrigerator. AT ALL.
Ditch the fridge. Is the convenience REAL, or just habitual? Remember that this was one of the selling points drummed into us to get us to buy fridges. Keep in mind that lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, and herbs will store incredibly well if the end of the stem is placed in water (just the tip of the stem should be submerged). You can also create a cool space in the basement to store your food.
Learn to patch clothes.
Ditch the TV.
Don't use batteries at all. Use the controls on the device directly. This will also make you just a little bit more active.
Don't buy new, buy second hand.
Lose the bad habits: You smoke? Drink? Gamble? Eat a chocolate bar and pop every day? You know you’re just tossing away money by the handful, right? Besides, none of that is anything close to healthy.
Cook at home and cook from scratch.
It’s fun – make it a game: For some people the extreme saving can become almost a game – where they find ways to save more and spend less – and win the game by reaching their goals.
You get to be more creative!: When you have set limits on how much you can spend you’ll be more creative about how you go out and have fun. Instead of an expensive dinner and movie out, why not a bike ride and a picnic at the park!
Simplified life with less stuff: When you’re buying less stuff, you’ll have less stuff to worry about, and a much more simplified life!
Sense of freedom: When you no longer work, or at least when you find yourself in a place where you’re able to work less if you want to, it will give you a big sense of freedom – of being able to do the things you want.
You can retire much sooner: If you go extreme with your savings, you’ll be able to retire much sooner than the average person. Go very extreme by saving 70-80% of your income, you might be able to retire in 7-10 years!
While most people immediately think of all the perceived downsides to being an extreme saver – like not being able to have any fun – they often don’t think of the benefits.
Peace of mind: When you’re saving so much of your income you’ll see your cash reserves and retirement accounts growing so much faster – which will give you a whole lot more peace of mind.
Extreme couponing: Some people will take couponing to a whole other level, finding ways to double up coupons, take advantage of sales, and only buy items when they’re on sale. In some cases they use multiple coupons to get items for free! The downside is that often this can be almost a full time job.
Extreme frugality: Do things other people aren’t willing to do – things like not using toilet paper, not flushing, showering and doing laundry at the same time, dumpster diving. Have a look at some folks who do that sort of thing. I tend to avoid most of these things.
Cancel all services except ones necessary to live: Some people won’t pay for anything except for the services they need to live – like heat, water, electricity. Even those they will do their best to skimp on.
Cut out the vices: If you’re a smoker, drinker or if you gamble on a regular basis, cutting out these vices can save you hundreds of dollars a year.
Live without AC or with minimal heating: I was reading on one site how one extreme saver would allow his home to get extremely warm in hot weather without using the AC, and allow the house to get down to as low as 65 in the winter. He said he adapted quickly to the new temps.
Downgrade to a tiny house or rent: Downgrade your living situation on one of your biggest expenses, and save big money.
Downgrade your car, or go without one: Some folks will go completely without a car, riding only on mass transit or biking to work. Others will downgrade from a nicer car to an older and cheaper model that gets decent mileage.
Buy everything used or freecycling: There are so many things that you can just buy used and save a ton of money. For example, we recently bought my son a new bike. Instead of spending €100-150 buying it new, we found a nice used one for only €40 at a local store. You can often find things free through your local freecycle site or facebook groups.
Never eat out: If you trying to be extreme in your saving, you may need to cut the eating out, and eat mainly at home. Not as extreme? Cut back on the number of times you eat out and you can still save a decent amount.
Cutting your hair at home is a great way to save money. In our household, men’s haircuts are $30/week. That’s a whopping $1,500+ per year. It can be even more expensive for women and beauty salon appointments that can rake up to $100 or more per visit!
Investing in some hair styling tools like clippers or hair cutting scissors is a good way to save money on your grooming expenses. Some have even gone so far as to shave their head, to keep maintenance and costs down. This includes men and women, by the way! Or, never cut it and just grow it out.
Lower cost of living, literally. Here are some ideas to do this: Live in a small house. Get roommates. Don’t use A/C or heat. Cut the cable.
Rent out unused rooms in your place with rental arbitrage. You might wonder how some people can make such extreme changes but these changes won’t last forever. Some of these money savers can help reduce your expenses by thousands each year.
Move your Family in with Family: Living with family and moving back home is such a budget saver. You can potentially pay no rent or very little rent, while you or you and the family take up a spare room or the basement in your parent’s place.
You might have to really give this one some thought. When you go to the grocery store, buy whole foods and use every part, if you can.
No junk food including, chips, cookies, crackers, or ice cream. No tea bags or coffee pods. No frozen dinners. Nothing in a box or can.
You will be preparing your meals and food at home. This will take more time and more work but your wallet will thank you.
You will be drinking filtered tap water. No more bottled water or water filters. You’ll enjoy good ol’ tap water. Invest in a reusable water bottle and fill it up when you’re on the go, at public water fountains or restrooms. This easy change will save you a ton of money!
Hand Wash Laundry: Save on laundry costs by hand washing and line drying your garments. It is more work but it reduces the wear on your clothes and saves you money.
Grow your Food: Growing your food is a cost effective way to lower your food budget. You can’t grow everything but there is a lot that you can grow, like expensive produce. Buying local from your farmer’s market is a good way to save money while supporting local farmers too.
Switch Banks: Switching banks comes with many perks including hundreds of dollars, free appliances and other freebies when you join a new bank. So, why not switch banks to take advantage?
Only shopping on sales means if it’s not on sale, you aren’t buying it.
Live in Your Car: A lot of people are starting to do this to save money. The cost of renting an apartment, up to $1,000+ is saved every month and can be applied to savings or your debts.
Regifting: Do you know those gifts you receive for yourself that you don’t like? Don’t throw them away, regift! This will save you a ton on gifts that you’ll be buying throughout the year for birthdays and other events.
Ask for Refunds: Have you ever paid a membership for the month and cancelled halfway through or before the month ended? Why not ask for a refund. Even a prorated refund is a win, getting money back for the portion of the month you didn’t use. A lot of people don’t even think to do this, but ask. You might be surprised how often you’ll get a refund back!
Live a Petless Life: Pets are expensive. They can bring joy and serenity to your life. They can truly feel like part of the family but the truth is, the upkeep for having a pet can be high.
One Meal a Day: Go even more extreme, eating just one meal a day. People who fast do this for the purposes of losing weight. Can you imagine how much you’d save on your grocery bill if you shopped for one meal a day, instead of three meals plus snacks!
Don’t shower every day. Shower every two days to save money on water and soap usage.
Reduce shampooing. Many experts believe that shampooing more than two or three times a week is not good for your hair–plus it will really save you on shampoo.
No more toilet paper. Some frugal people stop spending money on toilet paper and use newspaper or cloth towels instead.
Take a navy shower. With a navy shower, you only turn on water to get your body wet and again to rinse the soap off. You’ll save a ton of money on both water and the energy spent heating that water.
Darn your socks. If you get a hole in your socks, don’t throw them away, darn them.
Cut your own hair. Especially if you are a guy and can get away with a simple buzz cut, cutting your own hair is an excellent way to save money.
Collect rainwater. Collecting rainwater to use for your yard, garden, and any other use around the house will reduce your water bill.
Sell luxury items. Some things are just a luxury to own and actually cost more money just by having them. A boat, two or more cars, jet skis, a motorcycle, and other luxury items cost gas, insurance, maintenance, and storage to own.
Water down your products. Shampoo, cleaning supplies, and more will last much longer if you water them down a bit.
Use selective flushing. Many people choose not to flush the toilet after each use, limiting flushes to every second or third pee and when solids are present.
Get rid of big stuff. Sell your unused furniture, appliances you don’t use, or any of the other big stuff around your house that is just taking up space.
Learn to live without heat or air conditioning. Less than 100 years ago people lived just fine without central heat or air conditioning–and many countries around the world still do. Imagine how much you would save if you eliminated these two expenses.
Put high-energy electronics on a timer. Plug TVs, DVD players, and other high-energy usage appliances in to a timer so that they are not using energy at night and are available again during the day.
Live of the land. Grow your own vegetables and herbs and raise your own livestock for consumption to cut your grocery bill considerably.
Cook from scratch. Learning to cook your own food from scratch can save you a bundle.
Cut out alcohol. Alcohol costs plenty of money. Stop drinking to really save money.
Sell your car. This definitely feels extreme for some, but selling your car will save you a ton of money. With so many other forms of transportation available, why opt for the most expensive one?
Walk or ride your bike when your destination is only one or two miles away.
Public transportation. Take public transportation any time you can. A monthly pass for the bus or light rail is probably cheaper than gas, maintenance, and parking expenses.
Move to be closer to work or school. Make sure you live close enough to walk or bike to work or school so you don’t have to own a car.
Drive a scooter. Scooters are relatively inexpensive and get awesome gas mileage, often around 100 mpg.
Stop buying. It is extreme, but see if you can stop making purchases all together for 30 days. Not only will you save money, but you will also begin to see ways to do things without spending money for the long term.
Live like a farmer. Go to bed when the sun sets and rise when the sun rises so that you use less electricity.
You only need to drink water to survive. Cut out all coffee, soda and alcohol. Only drink water and sometimes tea.
Stop collecting, and start selling. There was a time when people thought their collections would bring them riches. Bou can find most items on resale sites for a fraction of their initial cost, leaving many people who sunk thousands of dollars into their “investments” wondering what happened.
Turn off the television. One big way to save money is to drastically cut down on the amount of television you watch. There are a lot of financial benefits to this: less exposure to spending-inducing ads, a lower electric bill (and perhaps a lower cable bill if you downgrade your subscription), more time to focus on other things in life — such as a side business — and so on.
Master the 30-day rule. Avoiding instant gratification is one of the most important rules of personal finance, and waiting 30 days to decide on a purchase is an excellent way to implement that rule.
Quite often, after a month has passed, you’ll find that the urge to buy has passed as well, and you’ll have saved yourself some money simply by waiting. If you’re on the fence about a purchase anyway, waiting a while can give you a better perspective on whether it’s truly worth the money.
Write a list before you go shopping – and stick to it. One of the easiest ways to save money is to only shop when you have a list. Because when you’re without one, you typically end up making impulse buys and unplanned purchases – all things that cost money.
Creating a list before you go to the grocery store is especially important. Not only can it help you buy items that fit with your meal plan, but it can also help you avoid buying food you might waste. Always create a list and, more importantly, stick to it.
Drink more water. Not only does drinking plenty of water have great health benefits — it has financial benefits, too. Drink a big glass of water before each meal in order to stay fuller longer and ultimately eat less. Not only will you save on the food bill, but you’ll also feel better after you become properly hydrated.
Drinking more water — whether in a refillable bottle or at restaurants — means spending less money on beverages like soda, juice, and tea. Remember: Filtered tap water is not only just as clean as bottled water, it’s also close to free.
For heaven’s sake, quit smoking. If you’re still a smoker, you have to know by now that your habit is not only expensive, but potentially deadly as well. If you want to add years to your life and save a boatload of money, the easiest thing to do is to stop smoking altogether.
Turn off the lights. Keeping the lights on in your home may not be expensive on a per-watt basis, but it sure does cost money over time.
To save as much as you can, turn off lights any time you leave your house – or even when you leave the room. Turning off lights when you have plenty of natural sunlight can also help keep your electric bill down over time. The bottom line: If you aren’t using a light, turn it off.
Cancel unused club memberships. Are you paying dues at a club that you never use? Like, for instance, a gym membership or a country club membership? If you’re on the fence about any of your memberships or find that you’re not using them very often, cancel them. Remember, you can always renew the membership at a later date if it turns out that you actually do miss it.
Remove your credit card numbers from your online accounts. It’s easy to spend online when you have your card information stored in an account – just click and buy. The best way to break this habit is to simply delete your card from the account. That way you really think about why you’re spending this money.
Declutter to save your sanity and some cash. Go into a room and go through every single item in it. Do you really need that item? Are you happy that it’s there, or would you be just fine if it were not? If you can find stuff to get rid of, get rid of it – it just creates clutter and it might have some value to others.
You can improve the perceived value of your house by removing unused items – and you’re likely to get a lot of cleaning done in the process. It’s a frugal win-win-win.
Master the 10-second rule. Whenever you pick up an item and add it to your cart or to take it to the checkout, stop for 10 seconds and ask yourself why you’re buying it and whether you actually need it or not. If you can’t find a good answer, put the item back. This keeps me from making impulse buys on a regular basis.
Cancel magazine subscriptions. Do you have a pile of unread magazines sitting around your house? It’s likely the result of a subscription that you’re not reading.
Go through your clothes – all of them. If you have a regular urge to buy clothes, go through everything that you have and see what you might find. Take the clothes from the back of the closet and bring them to the front, and suddenly your wardrobe will feel completely different. Take the clothes buried in your dresser and pull them to the top.
Learn how to dress minimally. Buy clothes that mix and match well and you won’t need nearly as many clothes. If you have five pants, seven shirts, and seven ties that all go together, you basically have an endless number of options already. This is exactly what I do in order to minimize clothing purchases and still look professional.
Try to fix things yourself. Years ago, it was far more difficult to find ways to fix everyday items we have in our homes. But today, it should be a piece of cake. You can find online tutorials and videos that show you how to fix almost anything, and all for free. No matter what you’re trying to fix, it’s always worth a shot. Learning a new skill never hurts either.
Keep an idea notebook in your pocket. I’ve wasted countless amounts of time and money simply because I’ve forgotten some of my best ideas. Nowadays, I keep a small notebook with me to jot down ideas so that I never forget anything important. This keeps me from forgetting the ideas I have throughout the day.
Start a garden. Gardening can be an inexpensive hobby if you have a yard. Just till up a patch, plant some plants, keep it weeded, and you’ll have a very inexpensive hobby that produces healthy food for your family.
I like planting a bunch of tomato plants, keeping them cared for, then enjoying the huge flood of tomatoes at the end of each summer. We like to eat them fresh, can them, and make tomato juice, sauce, paste, ketchup, pasta sauce, and pizza sauce.
Take public transportation. If the city’s transit system is available near you, take it to work instead of driving your car. It’s far cheaper and you won’t have to worry about the added expense or hassle of parking your vehicle either.
Go through your cell phone bill, look for services you don’t use, and ditch them. There are plenty of strategies to save money on your cell phone bill, and that includes switching from one of the big legacy providers to one of the smaller companies offering service in your area for less.
Hit the library – hard. Don’t look at a library as just a place to borrow books. Look at it as a free place to do all sorts of things. I’ve used it to learn a foreign language, meet people, use the Internet in a pinch, check out movies and CDs, grab local free newspapers, and keep up on community events. Best of all, it doesn’t cost a dime.
Don’t speed. Not only is speeding inefficient in terms of gasoline usage, it also can get you pulled over and cost you a bundle between a ticket and higher insurance premiums, as I discovered a while back. It’s far more cost-efficient to just drive the speed limit, keep that gas in the tank, and keep the cops off your tail.
Read more. Reading is one of the cheapest – and most beneficial – hobbies around. Most towns have a library available to the public – just go there and check out some books that interest you. Then, spend some of your free time in a cozy place in your house, reading away. You’ll learn something new, improve your reading ability, enjoy yourself, and not have to spend a dime.
Eat less meat. Meat is very expensive when you consider its nutritional value, especially as compared to vegetables and fruits. And in almost every case, protein-packed staples like beans offer a much better value. Even if you don’t want to become a full-fledged vegetarian, you can still save a bundle just by eating meat less often.
Exercise more. Go for a walk or a jog each evening, practice stretching, or partake in some light muscle exercise at home. These exercises can be done at home for free, but can lead to huge benefits to your health. Just set aside some time each day to get some exercise, and your body and wallet will thank you.
Don’t beat yourself up when you make a mistake. Even if you make 10 good choices, it’s easy to beat yourself up and feel like a failure over one bad choice. If you make a big mistake and realize it, think about why you realized it now instead of then, and try to apply that later on. The memory of that mistake can end up being very valuable, indeed.
Always keep looking ahead. Don’t let the mistakes of your past drag you down into more mistakes. Instead, look ahead to the future. Learn to see past mistakes for what they are – lessons that were meant to teach you something.
Sometimes the best life lessons are learned through life experience, good or bad, so embrace your past and don’t run from it. Promising to do better and setting goals can help keep mistakes where they belong – in the past.
Never give up. Whenever the struggle against debt feels like it’s too much, go read a personal finance blog and remember that there are a lot of people out there fighting the same fight. Read around through the archives and learn some new things – and perhaps get inspired to keep going, no matter what.
Stop  using contact lenses and buy qualtity glasses instead.
Lowering the thermostat on your water heater by a few degrees can save you between 3-5 percent in energy costs. And installing an on-demand or tankless water heater can deliver up to 30 percent savings compared with a standard storage tank water heater.
Shave your head. This is a great way for men (and women!) to simplify hair care and cut down on the cost of it.
Make your own toilet paper. By cutting up things like old t-shirts, you can make your own toilet paper. This may sound like one of the most extreme saving tips, but it will help you save money.
If you still use a fridge: Freeze water bottles instead of using the AC. Not only will this help you save money on cooling costs, it’s good for the environment.
Cancel your gym membership. Gym memberships can be costly if you're not using them. If you're not getting the full value out of your gym membership, then you should cancel it ASAP. This is one of the easier money saving tips as canceling a membership is a monthly cost that you can get rid of completely!
Get rid of your car. I know some of you might be thinking that I’m crazy for including this as one of the saving tips, but getting rid of you car might actually be something you want to consider. Or, if you are a two car household, just going down to one car could be one of the best ways to save money in 2019.
To be satisfied with a little, is the greatest wisdom; and he that increaseth his riches, increaseth his cares; but a contented mind is a hidden treasure, and trouble findeth it not. ~ Akhenaton

Everyone has the ability to increase resilience to stress. It requires hard work and dedication, but over time, you can equip yourself to handle whatever life throws your way without adverse effects to your health. Training your brain to manage stress won't just affect the quality of your life, but perhaps even the length of it. ~ Amy Morin
